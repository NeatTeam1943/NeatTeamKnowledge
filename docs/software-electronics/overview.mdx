## Software/Electronics, what's the difference?

Even when living under the same team, these two specialties are inherently different from one another. The main difference is the question when, when do we work on software? when do we work on the electronics?

#### Software

For software, the answer is simple: **All the time**. Software can be developed on any computer, in the workshop or outside it, with mostly zero dependencies on physical equipment like motors or actual robots. Software can be tested virtually, developed individually and planned separately.

Writing code that activates mechanisms is usually a piece of cake (depending on the mechanism of course), it isn't the main aspect of the software, that is (more often than not) the autonomous abilities of the robot.

#### Electronics

Here the answer is more difficult, this specialty does require physical components like motors, sensors, cameras, etc... Working on it usually comes inside the workshop. If software doesn't require a complete plan of the robot, can't we do the same? No. Planning and assembling electronics is done mainly at the start and end of each building process. Planning comes along the planning of mechanisms (Obviously, we want to know what sensors to use) and their modelling. When a mechanism is done building, assembling of electronic components is started.

## What's your role when building a robot?

> "Good software can make up for a bad robot, a good robot cannot make up bad software."

Often comes a time in every robots life when they must ask themselves:

> "Is my software impressive enough? Are my electronics pretty enough? Or am I just a piece of metal..."

Software/Electronics team is responsible for bringing life to this lump of beautiful metal, just like Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, this team springs inanimate objects to a life controlled by Glebi...
